## Development server

Run the Backend server first, with `node server.js`. If on a windows machine, run `node .\server.js`.

After the backend server is up on port 3000, test the output by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/data`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. If on a windows machine, run `npm run ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
